// Variables!
// To either create variables, you'll have to specifically have to write the data-type for that variables.. Or (initilization)
// String for "", Integer for numeric, Boolean for truth / false.

// There are 8 PRIMITIVE data-type and 1 special reference data-type (String).

/*
 * Boolean -> size: 1bit (Only holds two value) -> Value (true or false) [Primitive]
 * byte -> size: 1 byte -> Value -128 to 127 (Holding integer value) [Primitive]
 * short -> size: 2 byte -> Value -32,768 to 32,767 [Primitive]
 * int -> size: 4 bytes -> Value -2 billion to 2 billion [Primitive]
 * long -> size: 8 bytes -> Value -9 quintilion to 9 quintilion.
 * 
 * float -> size: 4 bytes -> Fractional number upto 6-7 digits (Example: 3.123456f) [Primitive]
 * double -> size: 8 bytes -> Fractional number upto 15 digits (Example: 3.142345124325123) [Primitive]
 * 
 * 
 * char -> size: 2 bytes -> Single-characters / letter / ASCII value (Example: 'f') Common conventions of signing char variables is surronded with one-single quotations.[Primitive] 
 * string -> size: varies -> A sequence of characters (Example: "Hello Mom!") [reference]
 */

// PRIMITIVE vs REFERENCE
/*
 * Primitive has 8 type, Reference is unlimited (user-defined)
 * Primitive can't store upto more 1 value, Reference can holds more than 1.
 * Primitive is faster, Reference is slower.
 * Primitive stores data, Reference stores memory.
 * Primitive uses less memory, Reference uses more memory.
