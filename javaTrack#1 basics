// Class is what'll we like to call as collections of related CODE.
// Every sets of syntax inside the curly braces on outer Main belongs to that class.
// There's also a main method. it'll goes AND executes first than other code.
// There are two distinguish differences between printLn and print.
// printLn adds (new lines) characters after outputting your text.. print doesn't.


public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
	 System.out.println("\"Java is fun!\"");
 }
}

// However, we could still try getting "new-line" with print statement by adding escape sequences.
// Escape sequence serves with backslashes "\".
/*
 * \n -> New-line characters
 * \t -> Adding tab
 * \ \ -> Allowing us to print double-quotations.. Also works to add backslashes into the string.
